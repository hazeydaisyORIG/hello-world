# hello-world

Here's a little something about me:
Misunderstood 27 year old female, who is just taking it day by day. 
Might just be one of the weirdest girls in the world. I am hot when in cold. Are you smelling what I'm stepping in?
Hazey is the name. I stay up in the clouds, elevation vibrations lifting my spirit into irie nation.
I feel the weight of the world suddenly fall off of me. Try not to let the guilt in me make me preturrn to the 
place that inprisons me. The mind is a powerful thing, so I tend to stay thinking positively.
